# MIPS Assembly Programs

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of MIPS assembly language programs created for the **SDEV-310-40** course. These programs demonstrate various concepts in MIPS assembly, including arithmetic operations, control flow, recursion, and string manipulation. The programs can be executed using MIPS simulators such as **SPIM** or **QtSPIM**.

## Programs
Hereâ€™s a brief description of each program included in this repository:

1. **`Calculates two numbers.asm`**:
   - Prompts the user for two integers and calculates the product, quotient, sum, and difference.
   - Outputs the results to the console.

2. **`Example 1 Multiply.asm`**:
   - Multiplies two predefined integers and displays the result.

3. **`Example 2 Fibonacci Series.asm`**:
   - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
   - Demonstrates the use of loops and recursion in MIPS.

4. **`Example 3 odd or even.asm`**:
   - Checks if a given integer is odd or even.
   - Uses conditional branching to determine the result.

5. **`First conversion of a C program 1.asm`**:
   - Translates a simple C program to MIPS assembly language (Part 1).
   - Demonstrates basic variable usage and arithmetic operations.

6. **`First conversion of a C program 2.asm`**:
   - Continues the conversion of a simple C program (Part 2).
   - Includes additional logic and control structures.

7. **`MIPS hello world.asm`**:
   - A basic "Hello, World!" program in MIPS assembly.
   - Demonstrates the use of system calls for printing strings.

8. **`multiply by 4.asm`**:
   - Multiplies an integer by 4 using bitwise shifts.
   - Highlights efficient arithmetic operations in MIPS.

9. **`new 1.asm`** and **`new 2.asm`**:
   - Placeholder programs with experimental code segments.
   - May include various testing and practice examples.

10. **`Sample code.asm`**:
    - A collection of sample MIPS code snippets for various operations.
    - Includes examples of arithmetic, loops, and string manipulation.

11. **`Text segment.asm`**:
    - Demonstrates the use of the `.text` segment in MIPS assembly.
    - Includes a simple program showcasing basic instructions.

## Requirements
- MIPS simulator (SPIM or QtSPIM recommended)
- Basic understanding of MIPS assembly language

## Usage
1. Open any `.asm` file in a MIPS simulator (e.g., SPIM or QtSPIM).
2. Load the program into the simulator.
3. Run the program and follow the prompts (if any).
4. View the output in the console.

## Running the Programs
- **QtSPIM**: 
  1. Open QtSPIM.
  2. Click **File > Open** and select the desired `.asm` file.
  3. Click **Run > Go** to execute the program.

- **SPIM**:
  1. Open SPIM.
  2. Load the `.asm` file using the **load** command.
  3. Type **run** to start the execution.
